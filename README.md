# H1N1-and-Flu-Vaccine-uptake-prediction


Amidst the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic,
vaccination has become a crucial public health measure, with
72 percent of the global population having received vaccines by
2023. As the immunity conferred by vaccines typically lasts for an
average of four months, booster doses are essential to maintain
protection. This research aims to delve into the disparities
in vaccine uptake, particularly for H1N1 and seasonal flub,
by examining the influence of socioeconomic backgrounds and
behaviours. We develop a predictive model for vaccine uptake,
but due to the presence of numerous feature columns in the
dataset, overfitting is a potential concern. Therefore, this study
investigates the impact of various feature engineering techniques
on models with differing complexities. The performance of each
method is evaluated using ROC-AUC scores and appropriate
statistical methods, offering insights to optimize vaccine classification
and enhance our understanding of H1N1 and seasonal flu
vaccine uptake.
